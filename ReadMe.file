Our website is for an entrepreneur and her business is called LeeLee's Cleaning Service. In her business she cleans houses, churches, court houses, etc. On our site, you find her prices and information on what all she does.
   
We chose our colors to grab people's attention and make our website look interesting and not boring to people. Unfortunately, we were unable to get pictures of her and her business, but we designed our website the way she might like it.  We made the background light pink because we thought it would make the website more vibrant. We wanted to incorporate all of our client's information about why she started her business, when she started it, etc.  

We have learned a lot about coding and teamwork. We hope you enjoy our website.
