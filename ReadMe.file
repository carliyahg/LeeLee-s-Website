Our website is for a entrepreneur and her businees is called LeeLee's Cleaning Service. In her business she cleans houses, churhes, court houses, etc. On our site, you find an award she received for her business, her prices, and information on what all she does.
   
   My partner and I chose our color scheme to grab people attention and make our website look interesting and not boring to people. Unfornately, we were unable to get pictures of her and her business, but we design our website the way she might like it. We chose that font because it was more appealing to us and it went well with the website. We made the background light pink because we thought it would make the website more vibrant. Overall, we wanted to incorporate all our clients information about why she started her business, when she started, and etc. Reponsiveness on our website across all devices were pretty good, but it looks better in landscape mode. Our content on our website is not alot but not to much.  
   
   As we get ready to turn to in our website we are very proud of how our website has turned out. We have learned alot about coding and team work. We hope you enjoy our website.
